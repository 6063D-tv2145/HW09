# HW09 Description (Sun Set Game)
1. Which library(ies) did you choose? Include link(s).  
  https://p5play.org/learn/
2. During class, you mentioned Flappy Bird, and because I used to obsess over this game in high school, I really wanted to try p5play for myself and see how the effect could be acheived.
  The concept itself was inspired by last weekend's daylight saving, which is arguably my least favorite part of the year, when the sun starts setting at 4pm. If the sun sets (touches the trees), you lose! Press R to restart the game.
3. One of the most challenging things was figuring out the abilities of the library and understanding what it's doing. Additionally, although we have learned about them plenty, I have not used objects and constructors in my mid-term, so I felt like I had to dig deeper to make sure they work the way they should in this homework.  
Additionally, despite wanting to make a curve, that would look like hills or a horizon, I figured it would be much easier to create rectangles (trees), spaced out, via a for loop.
4. After I somewhat got the mechanics into a satisfactory state, I wanted to make the game visually appealing, starting out with a sketch, then mockup in Figma and then implementing it in the draw function
